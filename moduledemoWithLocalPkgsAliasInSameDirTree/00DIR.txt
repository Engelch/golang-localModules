Manually added replace line:

```bash
module moduledemo

go 1.19

replace mypackage => ./mypackage
```

Commands:

```bash
$ go build
main.go:5:2: module mypackage provides package mypackage and is replaced but not required; to add it:
	go get mypackage
$ go get mypackage
go: added mypackage v0.0.0-00010101000000-000000000000
$ go build
$ # working
```

Learnings:

- the current main module does not need to be listed
- if a vendor directory is specified, the package is actually copied to that. Usually, I delete the copy
  and replace it by an s-link to the package. So all local pkg updates are immediately visisble. This
  is the desired behaviour.
